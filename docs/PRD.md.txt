# Clinic System â€“ PRD v0.1

## Problem
Mixed NHS/private dental clinic needs faster patient intake, reliable scheduling, and auditable clinical notes.

## Goals & Success Metrics
- Reduce receptionist booking time by **40%**
- Reduce no-show rate by **15%** via reminders
- Data entry errors down **30%**
- Accessibility: **AXE serious issues = 0**

## Users & Roles
- **Receptionist**: intake, schedule, cancel/reschedule
- **Clinician**: view day list, record notes, check-in patient
- **Admin**: manage users/roles, reports

## Scope (MVP)
1. **Auth & Roles** (JWT+refresh; guards & policies)
2. **Patient Registry** (typed reactive forms; merge duplicates)
3. **Appointments** (availability, reschedule/cancel, notifications)
4. **Notes/Observations** (autosave, version history, AuditLog)
5. **Reporting** (daily appts, no-shows, workload)

## Non-Functionals
- Security: route guards + server-side RBAC; validate inputs
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA
- Privacy: GDPR basics (data minimisation, DSRs)
- Performance: SSR + hydration for public/marketing pages

## Milestones
- M1: Patient Registry
- M2: Appointments
- M3: Notes + AuditLog
- M4: Reporting + SSR polish
